Open Systems Interconnection

1. Physical Layer
Transmits raw bit stream over physical medium.
Cables, switches - 0100001111101.
Signal convention to distinguish 1 and 0.
Simplex, Half Duplex, Full Duplex

2. Datalink Layer
Defines data formant over network.
Breaks packets into frames, flow control, error control in intra-network comms.

3. Network Layer
Decides physical path the data will take.
Breaks segments into packets and reassembles them on recv device.
Routing happens here, Subnet.

4.Transport Layer
Transmits data using TCP , UDP.
End-2-End communication b/w two devices.Breaks Session layer data into chunks (segments) 
and is responsible for reassembling segments into data that session layer can consume.
Flow control to balance fast vs slow internet speed. Error control for lost segments
restransmission (Inter-Network comms).

5. Session Layer
Maintains connection and is responsible for controlling ports , sessions.
Opening and closing communication between devices.
It ensures that session stays open long enough to transfer all the data being
exchanged and then closes connection.
It also synchronized data transfer with checkpoints. 

6. Presentation Layer
Ensures data is in a usable format and data encryption happens here.
Translation, encryption and compression of data.

7. Application Layer
Human-Computer interaction layer, apps access the network services.
HTTP, SMTP, Telnet, FTP, NFS, DNS, DHCP
