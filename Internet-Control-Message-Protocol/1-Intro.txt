*** About me ***
Network layer protocol to diagnose network communication issues in rotuters.
It can also be used in DDOS attacks.

ICMP is a connectionless protocol, no need of opening a connection like in TCP.
It also doesn't allow for targeting a specific port on a device.

*** Layer-3 DDOS Attacks ***

ICMP Flood Attack
Attacker overwhelm a target device with ICMP echo-request packets. The target has to process and 
respond to each packet, consuming its cpu and legit users can't be serviced.

Ping of Death Attack
Attacker sends a large ping packet and the target re-assembles fragmented data packet into its
maximum-exceeding size - which causes buffer overflow.
Old network equipment is susceptible to it.

Smurf Attack
Attacker sends an ICMP packet with spoofed source IP address. Device will reply to spoofed IP and
flood victim with unwanted ICMP packets.
Possible in legacy devices.

Attackers can alos use GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation) packets.
